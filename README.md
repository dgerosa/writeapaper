# writeapaper

This is a template repository to write scientific papers with latex. 


A github action compiles the paper at every commit. The latest version is made available at 
[github.com/dgerosa/writeapaper/blob/build/draft.pdf](https://github.com/dgerosa/writeapaper/blob/build/draft.pdf)

There are two variables in `.github/workflows/writeapaper.yml` that you might want to change, which set the directory (`DIR`) and the filename (`FILE`) for the tex file you want to compile.


TODO: 
- [x] Deploy pdf to fixed url
- [ ] Add templates for several journals (those I care about)
